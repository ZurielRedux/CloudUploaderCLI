# CloudUploaderCLI
Capstone Project: a Cloud Uploader CLI

This simple bash script allows you to continually enter the names of files to be uploaded to the cloudupload container of your storage container.

To set this up, edit the credentials variables at the top of the script to designate the storage account name, key and connection string as well as the desired blob container.
